![Sceenshot](public/screenshot.png)

A streamlined web application for managing restaurant reservations. This project focuses on a seamless user journey, moving from initial booking details to final customer confirmation within a unified, modern interface.
Key Features

    Sequential Booking Flow: A multi-step reservation process that separates table details (date, time, guests) from customer contact information to reduce cognitive load.

    Controlled Form State: Real-time synchronization of user input with the application state, allowing for immediate feedback and dynamic UI updates.

    Midnight Gold Aesthetic: A custom-designed, dark-themed minimalist interface focused on readability and a premium "Fine Dining" feel.

    Instant Confirmation: A dynamic transition system that displays a success summary upon completion without requiring a page reload.
